# api are mechanisms that enable 2 software components such as the frontend and backend of an application to communicate with each 
# other using a designed set of rules , protocols and data formats
# APIs to enable different software systems to communicate and share data, allowing developers to integrate existing services rather 
# than building everything from scratch. APIs act as intermediaries, defining rules for how applications interact, which promotes 
# automation, innovation, security, and cost efficiency by simplifying software development and enabling seamless connectivity between 
# various platforms and devices

# Fast API is a modern , high performance web framework for building APIs with python
# Starlette --> manages how your API recieves requests and sends back messages
# Pydantic -->  checks if the data coming into your API is correct and in the right format

# philosophy of FastAPI --> fast to run and fast to code || web server for tracking incoming HTTP request of the client
# server gateway interface --> establishes 2 way communication between api and web server
# FastAPI has asynchronous server gateway interface and also supports async and await features

# why is it fast 
# automatic input validation
# auto generated interactive documentation
# seamless integration with modern eosystem
